
# Odoo deployment on docker with postgresql DB and nginx reverse proxy

I have created a docker-compose file and it is all-in-one package.

### Steps to start:

Just clone the repository to your vagrant installed linux system and run vagrant up.

Finally, everything should be configured right and ready to test.
